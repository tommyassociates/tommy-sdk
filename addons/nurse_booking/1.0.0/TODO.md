3. Can the Wallet account labeled "Mountain Elders" be renamed "山缘老人公寓" in CN and "ShanYuan Account" in English.

4. I have been unable to click on the Bookings button. When I load it into browser I get code 500, Cannot read file /var/app/current/addons/nurse_booking/1.0.0/views/booking.html  error

8. When I have finished booking and I click into "View Order Details", when I click the back button, can that return the user to the Mini Program home screen.
