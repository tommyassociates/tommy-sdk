# Tommy Addon SDK

The Tommy Addon SDK enables developers to build custom addons and integrations that extend Tommy's core functionality.

The SDK itself emulates the live Tommy environment, so you can develop addons on your local machine that will integrate seamlessly with the live app.

To get started building Tommy addons read the [Developers Guide](http://docs.mytommy.com/).
