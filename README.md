# Tommy SDK

The Tommy SDK enables developers to build custom mini programs and integrations that extend Tommy's functionality.

The SDK itself emulates the live Tommy environment, so you can develop mini programs on your local machine that will integrate seamlessly with the live app.

Tommy is working with a limited number of Alpha testing developers before the SDK will be made available to Partners.

To get started building Tommy Mini Programs read the [Developers Guide](http://docs.mytommy.com/).
